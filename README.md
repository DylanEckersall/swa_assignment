# SWA Assignment

My Software Architectures assignment - An educational maths game for kids which implements the factory and singleton software design patterns and utilises the JavaFX 2 API.

The HighScoresUI class has not been version controlled past it's current state as it contains database connection information.
(This will be updated to use an SQLite Database soon..)

No images have been version controlled, therefore cloning/downloading this repository will produce an incomplete version of the game. Download a working .JAR executable for the game here:
